# 📜 **Database Design in Document Databases (MongoDB & AWS DocumentDB) – The Ultimate Guide 🚀**

Designing a **document database schema** requires a different mindset than **SQL databases**. Instead of **normalization**, document databases emphasize **flexibility, denormalization, and embedded data** for **high performance and scalability**.

## 🏗 **1️⃣ Data Modeling – Relationships in DocumentDB**

Unlike SQL, where relationships are handled with **foreign keys**, NoSQL databases handle relationships through **embedding (denormalization) or referencing (normalization)**.

### **🔗 One-to-One (1-1) Relationship**

#### ✅ **Best for: Rarely changing, tightly coupled data.**

- **Embedding is preferred** unless the data grows too large.
- **Example**: A user profile and its settings.

#### **📜 Example 1: Embedded Document (Denormalization)**

```json
{
  "_id": "user123",
  "name": "Ahmed",
  "email": "ahmed@example.com",
  "settings": {
    "theme": "dark",
    "language": "en"
  }
}
```

✅ **Faster Reads** – One query retrieves everything.  
❌ **Not Scalable** – If `settings` grows too large, it bloats the document.

#### **📜 Example 2: Referenced Document (Normalization)**

```json
// users collection
{
  "_id": "user123",
  "name": "Ahmed",
  "email": "ahmed@example.com",
  "settingsId": "settings001"
}

// settings collection
{
  "_id": "settings001",
  "userId": "user123",
  "theme": "dark",
  "language": "en"
}
```

✅ **Scalable** – Useful if settings grow large or change frequently.  
❌ **Requires Additional Query** – Need a second query to fetch `settings`.

---

### **🔗 One-to-Many (1-N) Relationship**

#### ✅ **Best for: Small related datasets (embedding) OR large, growing datasets (referencing).**

- **Use embedding when sub-documents are small and frequently read together.**
- **Use referencing when sub-documents are large or change frequently.**

#### **📜 Example 1: Embedded Document (Small Subdocuments)**

```json
{
  "_id": "post123",
  "title": "How DocumentDB Stores Data",
  "comments": [
    { "user": "Ahmed", "text": "Great post!" },
    { "user": "Sara", "text": "Very helpful!" }
  ]
}
```

✅ **Fast Reads** – No need to join collections.  
❌ **Limited Scalability** – Too many comments make the document too large.

#### **📜 Example 2: Referenced Document (Large Subdocuments)**

```json
// posts collection
{
  "_id": "post123",
  "title": "How DocumentDB Stores Data",
  "commentIds": ["comment001", "comment002"]
}

// comments collection
{
  "_id": "comment001",
  "postId": "post123",
  "user": "Ahmed",
  "text": "Great post!"
}
```

✅ **Scalable** – Each comment is independent and queryable.  
❌ **Requires a Join-Like Query** – Slower than embedding.

🔥 **Hybrid Approach:** Store **recent comments in the post** and move older ones to a separate collection.

---

### **🔗 Many-to-Many (N-M) Relationship**

### ✅ **Best for: Flexible, complex relationships (e.g., Users & Groups).**

- **Use referencing with an intermediate "Join Collection".**

### **📜 Example: Users & Groups (Join Table)**

```json
// users collection
{
  "_id": "user123",
  "name": "Ahmed"
}

// groups collection
{
  "_id": "group456",
  "name": "Developers"
}

// user_groups collection (Join Table)
{
  "_id": "rel001",
  "userId": "user123",
  "groupId": "group456"
}
```

✅ **Flexible & Scalable** – Users and groups can grow independently.  
❌ **Requires Multiple Queries** – Needs lookup on `user_groups`.

---

## 🎯 **2️⃣ Best Design Practices for NoSQL Schema**

✅ **Embed small, frequently accessed data** (e.g., user profile settings).  
✅ **Reference large, growing datasets** (e.g., comments, logs).  
✅ **Use hybrid approaches** when mixing reads & writes (e.g., recent comments embedded, old ones referenced).  
✅ **Avoid deeply nested documents** (MongoDB limits document depth to **100 levels**).  
✅ **Break large documents into separate collections** if they approach the **16MB BSON limit**.

## ⚡ **3️⃣ Indexing for Performance Optimization**

Indexes in MongoDB **boost query performance** but consume **extra storage**.

### 🔍 **Types of Indexes in DocumentDB**

| **Index Type**                                | **Best For**                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Single-Field Index** `{ "name": 1 }`        | Queries filtering by one field.         |
| **Compound Index** `{ "name": 1, "age": -1 }` | Queries using multiple fields together. |
| **Text Index** `{ "title": "text" }`          | Full-text search queries.               |
| **Hashed Index** `{ "email": "hashed" }`      | Sharding-based indexing.                |
| **Wildcard Index** `{ "$**": 1 }`             | Indexes all fields dynamically.         |

✅ **Use compound indexes for filtering on multiple fields.**  
✅ **Avoid indexing fields with high-cardinality unless needed.**  
✅ **Use covered indexes to fetch only indexed fields.**

## 🌍 **4️⃣ Partitioning & Replication for Scalability**

✅ **Replication (High Availability):**

- **Primary-Replica Architecture** ensures failover support.
- **Read queries can be distributed to secondaries** for scaling.

✅ **Partitioning (Sharding for Horizontal Scaling):**

- **MongoDB automatically splits data** into shards based on a **shard key**.
- Each shard contains **a subset of the dataset** and scales independently.

📌 **Sharding is needed for massive datasets (> TB scale).**

---

## 📡 **5️⃣ Sharding in MongoDB (Massive Scale Deployments)**

Sharding **solves the problem of large datasets that exceed a single server’s capacity**.

### 🔥 **How Sharding Works**

- **Data is distributed across multiple shards.**
- **Each shard contains a subset of data.**
- **A Config Server maintains metadata about data distribution.**
- **A Query Router (mongos) routes queries to the correct shard.**

### **📜 Example Sharding Key Selection**

| **Shard Key Type**  | **Best For**               | **Example**                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Hashed Key**      | Evenly distributes writes  | `{ "_id": "hashed" }`          |
| **Range-Based Key** | Sequential access patterns | `{ "createdAt": 1 }`           |
| **Compound Key**    | Complex queries            | `{ "region": 1, "userId": 1 }` |

🚨 **Choosing the wrong shard key can lead to an unbalanced cluster!**
