# 🐘 **High Availability (HA) Solutions for PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL **High Availability (HA)** ensures that your database remains operational even in the event of failures. HA solutions help achieve **zero-downtime**, **fault tolerance**, and **automatic recovery**.

High Availability in PostgreSQL is **achieved in three steps**:

**1️⃣ Replication** - Keeping multiple copies of the database in sync.  
**2️⃣ Failover** - Automatically switching to a standby server if the primary fails.  
**3️⃣ Failback** - Restoring the original primary server after recovery.

Let's explore each step conceptually and discuss the different methods available.

## 1️⃣ **Replication (Keeping Data Synchronized) 🔁**

Replication ensures that data from the **Primary Server** is continuously copied to one or more **Standby Servers**.

✅ **Why Replication?**

- Ensures **data redundancy** in case of failures.
- Enables **load balancing** by allowing read queries on standby servers.
- Supports **disaster recovery** and **point-in-time recovery (PITR)**.

| **Popular Examples**                  | Built-in Log Shipping          | Built-in Streaming Replication | Built-in Logical Replication, `pglogical` | `Pgpool-II`                |
| **Commit Method**                     | WAL                            | WAL                            | Logical Decoding                          | SQL                        |
| **Allows Multiple Primary Servers**   | ❌                             | ❌                             | ✅                                        | ✅                         |
| **No Waiting for Multiple Servers**   | With Sync Off                  | With Sync Off                  | With Sync Off                             | ✅                         |
| **Primary Failure Won’t Lose Data**   | With Sync On                   | With Sync On                   | With Sync On                              | ✅                         |
| **Replicas Accept Read-Only Queries** | With Hot Standby               | ✅                             | ✅                                        | ✅                         |
| **Per-Table Granularity**             | ❌                             | ❌                             | ✅                                        | ✅                         |
| **No Conflict Resolution Needed**     | ✅                             | ✅                             | ❌                                        | ❌                         |

🔹 **Key Takeaways:**

- **Streaming Replication** (physical) is **faster** and supports read-replicas.
- **Logical Replication** (table-level) allows **selective data replication**.
- **Pgpool-II** enables **load balancing** and **replication middleware**.

## 2️⃣ **Failover (Automatic Switching to Standby) 🔄**

Failover is the **process of automatically promoting a standby server** to replace the failed primary server.

✅ **Why Failover?**

- Ensures minimal **downtime** in case of failures.
- Enables **automatic recovery**.
- Prevents **data loss** when used with **synchronous replication**.

### 🛠 **Types of Failover Solutions**

1. **Manual Failover** (Not Recommended)

   - DBA manually promotes the standby server.
   - Requires **human intervention**, leading to **longer downtime**.

2. **Automatic Failover with Tools**

   - Uses monitoring tools like **Patroni, repmgr, Pgpool-II, or EDB Failover Manager**.
   - Detects primary failure and **automatically promotes** the best standby server.

3. **Load Balancer-Based Failover**
   - Uses **HAProxy** or **Pgpool-II** to route queries to the healthy server.
   - Provides **automatic redirection** without application downtime.

## 3️⃣ **Failback (Restoring the Original Primary) 🔄**

Failback is the process of **restoring the original primary server** after it has recovered from failure.

✅ **Why Failback?**

- Ensures **proper replication topology**.
- Brings back the **original server** without downtime.
- Prevents **data inconsistency** in a cluster.

### 🛠 **Types of Failback Solutions**

1. **Re-synchronizing the Old Primary as a New Standby**

   - Wipes old primary data and resyncs it as a standby.
   - Requires tools like **pg_basebackup, rsync, or Patroni**.

2. **Switchover (Planned Failover & Failback)**

   - Used when **migrating databases** or **doing maintenance**.
   - Swaps the **primary and standby roles** without downtime.

3. **Rebuilding the Cluster Manually**
   - Can involve **manually restoring backups**.
   - Used when automated solutions are unavailable.

## 🎯 **Final Summary: PostgreSQL High Availability Flow**

**🔹 Replication** → Keeps standby servers in sync.  
**🔹 Failover** → Automatically promotes a standby when the primary fails.  
**🔹 Failback** → Restores the original primary once it's healthy.
