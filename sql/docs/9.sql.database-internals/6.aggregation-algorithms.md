# Aggregations Algorithms

## Aggregation Steps

1. Split input rows into groups

   - Only if there is a `GROUP BY` or `DISTINCT`
   - Otherwise, treat everything as one big group.

2. Combine values within each group

   - May use functions: `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `SUM`, `AVG` ..etc

3. Output one row per group
